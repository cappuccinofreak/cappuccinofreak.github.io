## PhD studentships
I am currently looking for possible PhD students to join the Knowledge Engineering Group at Liverpool to work on a range of PhD topics, with a focus on Agentic AI and the use of knowledge and reasoning across distributed agents, agent based services, and intelligent service usage on ubiquitous and portable devices.  Funding is subject to status and availability, and interested applicants should contact me in the first instance expressing an interest.  Studies typically commence at the beginning of the academic year, but may be rescheduled if necessary.

## Intern Positions
I am currently not looking for intern positions, and would ask interested parties not to contact me regarding this.
